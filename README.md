# Music Sample and News Site 
### http://badvibes.surge.sh

I created a music news website with a search engine by which users can discover new music and sample their favorite tunes. This is purely a promotional website using the Apple iTunes API and a news API sourced from www.newsapi.org.

## `Developer Tools`

### React
Using the concepts and skills I learned through General Assembly, I was able to construct a website that consists of various function and class components, dyanmically linked by react routing and linking.

### Axios
An HTTP client that automatically transforms JSON data as opposed to the two-step process of .fetch().

### Postman
Postman was very helpful in this project because of its ability to seamlessly make API requests and allow me visualize the data structures I wanted to work with.

### React Parallax
This was the first time I implemented an node package that allowed me to expand the functionality of my website. The parallax effect gives the site's an organic and interactive user experience as the page is scrolled up and down.

## Most Viable Product
The goal was to produce a site that has a search bar to grabs data from the iTunes API and generates results for users to find music they are interested in. 

- Set up routes and links
- Access API
- Render data to front-end

## Post MVP
As I was building the app, I naturally wanted to add more features I found useful or visually pleasant in site I have previously visited

- React Parallax
- Second API for news feed
- Ability to search news API simultaneously with music search
- Artist/track info button adjacent to music player
